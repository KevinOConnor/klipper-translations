msgid "Mesh Interpolation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`algorithm: lagrange` *Default Value: lagrange* The algorithm used to "
"interpolate the mesh. May be `lagrange` or `bicubic`. Lagrange interpolation "
"is capped at 6 probed points as oscillation tends to occur with a larger "
"number of samples. Bicubic interpolation requires a minimum of 4 probed points"

"interpolation is done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`bicubic_tension: 0.2` *Default Value: 0.2* If the `algorithm` option is set "
"to bicubic it is possible to specify the tension value. The higher the tension"

msgid "Move Splitting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`move_check_distance: 5` *Default Value: 5* The minimum distance to check for "
"the desired change in Z before performing a split. In this example, a move "
"longer than 5mm will be traversed by the algorithm. Each 5mm a mesh Z lookup "
"will occur, comparing it with the Z value of the previous move. If the delta "
"meets the threshold set by `split_delta_z`, the move will be split and "
"traversal will continue. This process repeats until the end of the move is "
"reached, where a final adjustment will be applied. Moves shorter than the "
"`move_check_distance` have the correct Z adjustment applied directly to the "
"move without traversal or splitting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`split_delta_z: .025` *Default Value: .025* As mentioned above, this is the "
"minimum deviation required to trigger a move split. In this example, any Z "
"value with a deviation +/- .025mm will trigger a split."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mesh Fade"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When \"fade\" is enabled Z adjustment is phased out over a distance defined by"
" the configuration. This is accomplished by applying small adjustments to the "
"layer height, either increasing or decreasing depending on the shape of the "
"bed. When fade has completed, Z adjustment is no longer applied, allowing the "
"top of the print to be flat rather than mirror the shape of the bed. Fade also"
" may have some undesirable traits, if you fade too quickly it can result in "
"visible artifacts on the print. Also, if your bed is significantly warped, "
"fade can shrink or stretch the Z height of the print. As such, fade is "
"disabled by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_start: 1` *Default Value: 1* The Z height in which to start phasing out "
"adjustment. It is a good idea to get a few layers down before starting the "
"fade process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`fade_end: 10` *Default Value: 0* The Z height in which fade should complete. "
"If this value is lower than `fade_start` then fade is disabled. This value may"
" be adjusted depending on how warped the print surface is. A significantly "
"warped surface should fade out over a longer distance. A near flat surface may"
" be able to reduce this value to phase out more quickly. 10mm is a sane value "
"to begin with if using the default value of 1 for `fade_start`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Faulty Regions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible for some areas of a bed to report inaccurate results when "
"probing due to a \"fault\" at specific locations. The best example of this are"
" beds with series of integrated magnets used to retain removable steel sheets."
" The magnetic field at and around these magnets may cause an inductive probe "
"to trigger at a distance higher or lower than it would otherwise, resulting in"
" a mesh that does not accurately represent the surface at these locations. "
"**Note: This should not be confused with probe location bias, which produces "
"inaccurate results across the entire bed.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `faulty_region` options may be configured to compensate for this affect. "
"If a generated point lies within a faulty region bed mesh will attempt to "
"probe up to 4 points at the boundaries of this region. These probed values "
"will be averaged and inserted in the mesh as the Z value at the generated (X, "
"Y) coordinate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`faulty_region_{1...99}_min` `faulty_region_{1..99}_max` *Default Value: None "
"(disabled)* Faulty Regions are defined in a way similar to that of mesh "
"itself, where minimum and maximum (X, Y) coordinates must be specified for "
"each region. A faulty region may extend outside of a mesh, however the "
"alternate points generated will always be within the mesh boundary. No two "
"regions may overlap."

"`fade_target: 0` *Default Value: The average Z value of the mesh* The "
