"During this guide, it may be necessary to make changes to the Klipper config"
" file. Be sure to issue a RESTART command after every change to the config "
"file to ensure that the change takes effect (type \"restart\" in the "
"Octoprint terminal tab and then click \"Send\"). It's also a good idea to "
"issue a STATUS command after every RESTART to verify that the config file is"
" successfully loaded."
msgstr ""
"在本指南中，可能需要修改 Klipper 的配置文件。请务必在每次修改配置文件后发送 RESTART 命令，以确保修改生效（在 Octoprint "
"终端标签中输入 \"RESTART\"（重启），然后点击 \"发送\"）。在每次 RESTART 之后最好再发出一次 STATUS "
"（状态）命令，以验证配置文件是否成功加载。"

msgid "Verify temperature"

msgstr "![octoprint-温度](img/octoprint-temperature.png)"

msgid ""
"Verify that the temperature of the nozzle and bed (if applicable) are "
"present and not increasing. If it is increasing, remove power from the "
"printer. If the temperatures are not accurate, review the \"sensor_type\" "
"and \"sensor_pin\" settings for the nozzle and/or bed."

msgid "Verify M112"
msgstr "验证 M112"

msgid ""
"Navigate to the Octoprint terminal tab and issue an M112 command in the "
"terminal box. This command requests Klipper to go into a \"shutdown\" state."
" It will cause Octoprint to disconnect from Klipper - navigate to the "
"Connection area and click on \"Connect\" to cause Octoprint to reconnect. "
"Then navigate to the Octoprint temperature tab and verify that temperatures "
"continue to update and the temperatures are not increasing. If temperatures "
"are increasing, remove power from the printer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The M112 command causes Klipper to go into a \"shutdown\" state. To clear "

msgid "Verify heaters"
msgstr "验证加热器"

msgid ""
"Navigate to the Octoprint temperature tab and type in 50 followed by enter "
"in the \"Tool\" temperature box. The extruder temperature in the graph "
"should start to increase (within about 30 seconds or so). Then go to the "
"\"Tool\" temperature drop-down box and select \"Off\". After several minutes"
" the temperature should start to return to its initial room temperature "
"value. If the temperature does not increase then verify the \"heater_pin\" "
"setting in the config."

msgstr "如果打印机带有热床，则用热床再次执行上述测试。"

msgid "Verify stepper motor enable pin"
msgstr "验证步进电机enable（启用）引脚"

msgid ""
"Verify that all of the printer axes can manually move freely (the stepper "
"motors are disabled). If not, issue an M84 command to disable the motors. If"
" any of the axes still can not move freely, then verify the stepper "
"\"enable_pin\" configuration for the given axis. On most commodity stepper "
"motor drivers, the motor enable pin is \"active low\" and therefore the "
"enable pin should have a \"!\" before the pin (for example, \"enable_pin: "
"!ar38\")."
msgstr ""

msgid "Verify endstops"
msgstr "验证限位开关"

msgid ""
"Manually move all the printer axes so that none of them are in contact with "
"an endstop. Send a QUERY_ENDSTOPS command via the Octoprint terminal tab. It"
" should respond with the current state of all of the configured endstops and"
" they should all report a state of \"open\". For each of the endstops, rerun"
" the QUERY_ENDSTOPS command while manually triggering the endstop. The "
"QUERY_ENDSTOPS command should report the endstop as \"TRIGGERED\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the endstop appears inverted (it reports \"open\" when triggered and "
"vice-versa) then add a \"!\" to the pin definition (for example, "
"\"endstop_pin: ^!ar3\"), or remove the \"!\" if there is already one "
"present."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the endstop does not change at all then it generally indicates that the "
"endstop is connected to a different pin. However, it may also require a "
"change to the pullup setting of the pin (the '^' at the start of the "
"endstop_pin name - most printers will use a pullup resistor and the '^' "
"should be present)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Verify stepper motors"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the STEPPER_BUZZ command to verify the connectivity of each stepper "
"motor. Start by manually positioning the given axis to a midway point and "
"then run `STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_x`. The STEPPER_BUZZ command will "
"cause the given stepper to move one millimeter in a positive direction and "
"then it will return to its starting position. (If the endstop is defined at "
"position_endstop=0 then at the start of each movement the stepper will move "
"away from the endstop.) It will perform this oscillation ten times."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the stepper does not move at all, then verify the \"enable_pin\" and "
"\"step_pin\" settings for the stepper. If the stepper motor moves but does "
"not return to its original position then verify the \"dir_pin\" setting. If "
"the stepper motor oscillates in an incorrect direction, then it generally "
"indicates that the \"dir_pin\" for the axis needs to be inverted. This is "
"done by adding a '!' to the \"dir_pin\" in the printer config file (or "
"removing it if one is already there). If the motor moves significantly more "
"or significantly less than one millimeter then verify the "
"\"rotation_distance\" setting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run the above test for each stepper motor defined in the config file. (Set "
"the STEPPER parameter of the STEPPER_BUZZ command to the name of the config "
"section that is to be tested.) If there is no filament in the extruder then "
"one can use STEPPER_BUZZ to verify the extruder motor connectivity (use "
"STEPPER=extruder). Otherwise, it's best to test the extruder motor "
"separately (see the next section)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After verifying all endstops and verifying all stepper motors the homing "
"mechanism should be tested. Issue a G28 command to home all axes. Remove "
"power from the printer if it does not home properly. Rerun the endstop and "
"stepper motor verification steps if necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Verify extruder motor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To test the extruder motor it will be necessary to heat the extruder to a "
"printing temperature. Navigate to the Octoprint temperature tab and select a"
" target temperature from the temperature drop-down box (or manually enter an"
" appropriate temperature). Wait for the printer to reach the desired "
"temperature. Then navigate to the Octoprint control tab and click the "
"\"Extrude\" button. Verify that the extruder motor turns in the correct "
"direction. If it does not, see the troubleshooting tips in the previous "
"section to confirm the \"enable_pin\", \"step_pin\", and \"dir_pin\" "
"settings for the extruder."

msgid "Calibrate PID settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Klipper supports [PID control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller)"
" for the extruder and bed heaters. In order to use this control mechanism it"
" is necessary to calibrate the PID settings on each printer. (PID settings "
"found in other firmwares or in the example configuration files often work "
"poorly.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To calibrate the extruder, navigate to the OctoPrint terminal tab and run "
"the PID_CALIBRATE command. For example: `PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder "
"TARGET=170`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the completion of the tuning test run `SAVE_CONFIG` to update the "
"printer.cfg file the new PID settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the printer has a heated bed and it supports being driven by PWM (Pulse "
"Width Modulation) then it is recommended to use PID control for the bed. "
"(When the bed heater is controlled using the PID algorithm it may turn on "
"and off ten times a second, which may not be suitable for heaters using a "
"mechanical switch.) A typical bed PID calibration command is: `PID_CALIBRATE"
" HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Next steps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This guide is intended to help with basic verification of pin settings in "
"the Klipper configuration file. Be sure to read the [bed "
"leveling](Bed_Level.md) guide. Also see the [Slicers](Slicers.md) document "
"for information on configuring a slicer with Klipper."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After one has verified that basic printing works, it is a good idea to "
"consider calibrating [pressure advance](Pressure_Advance.md)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It may be necessary to perform other types of detailed printer calibration -"
" a number of guides are available online to help with this (for example, do "
"a web search for \"3d printer calibration\"). As an example, if you "
"experience the effect called ringing, you may try following [resonance "
"compensation](Resonance_Compensation.md) tuning guide."
