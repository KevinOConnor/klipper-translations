msgstr "探针X/Y偏移校准"

msgid ""
"To calibrate the X and Y offset, navigate to the OctoPrint \"Control\" tab, "
"home the printer, and then use the OctoPrint jogging buttons to move the "
"head to a position near the center of the bed."
msgstr ""
"为校正X、Y偏移值，首先打开OctoPrint中的“控制（control）”子页面，进行三轴的归零，然后用OctoPrint内的手调按钮将喷嘴移动到热床的"
"中央位置。"

msgid ""
"Place a piece of blue painters tape (or similar) on the bed underneath the "
"probe. Navigate to the OctoPrint \"Terminal\" tab and issue a PROBE command:"
msgstr "探针下方的热床上贴上一片美纹纸（或类似的薄片）。转到OctoPrint的“命令行（Terminal）”子页，输入PROBE 命令并回车："

msgid ""
"Place a mark on the tape directly under where the probe is (or use a similar"
" method to note the location on the bed)."
msgstr "在探针正下方的美纹纸上，用记号笔标注探针触发的位置（或使用其他方法记录下探针触发时的物理位置）。"

msgid ""
"Issue a `GET_POSITION` command and record the toolhead XY location reported "
"by that command. For example if one sees:"
msgstr "在命令行中输入`GET_POSITION`命令，回车，记录下此时打印头的XY位置。输出如下："

msgid ""
"then one would record a probe X position of 46.5 and probe Y position of 27."
msgstr "此时，我们可以知道探针触发的X坐标为46.5，Y坐标为27。"

msgid ""
"After recording the probe position, issue a series of G1 commands until the "

msgstr "记录下上述的坐标后，在命令行使用一系列的 G1 命令，使喷嘴移动到热床的记号的正上方。例如："

msgid ""
"to move the nozzle to an X position of 57 and Y of 30. Once one finds the "
"position directly above the mark, use the `GET_POSITION` command to report "
"that position. This is the nozzle position."
msgstr "将喷嘴移动到X 57， Y 30上。当喷嘴的位置刚好位于几号上时，在命令行键入 `GET_POSITION` 获得此时喷嘴所在的坐标。"

msgid ""
"The x_offset is then the `nozzle_x_position - probe_x_position` and y_offset"
" is similarly the `nozzle_y_position - probe_y_position`. Update the "
"printer.cfg file with the given values, remove the tape/marks from the bed, "
"and then issue a `RESTART` command so that the new values take effect."

msgid "Calibrating probe Z offset"
msgstr "探针Z偏移值校准"

msgid ""
"Providing an accurate probe z_offset is critical to obtaining high quality "
"prints. The z_offset is the distance between the nozzle and bed when the "
"probe triggers. The Klipper `PROBE_CALIBRATE` tool can be used to obtain "
"this value - it will run an automatic probe to measure the probe's Z trigger"
" position and then start a manual probe to obtain the nozzle Z height. The "
"probe z_offset will then be calculated from these measurements."
msgstr ""
"准确的探针 z_offset 是高质量打印的基础。z_offset "
"是*探针触发时*探针和喷嘴之间的高度差。Klipper中`PROBE_CALIBRATE` "
"工具可用于测量这个值——首先，该工具会自动地使用探针进行一次测量，在触发"

msgid ""
"Start by homing the printer and then move the head to a position near the "
"center of the bed. Navigate to the OctoPrint terminal tab and run the "
"`PROBE_CALIBRATE` command to start the tool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tool will perform an automatic probe, then lift the head, move the "
"nozzle over the location of the probe point, and start the manual probe "
"tool. If the nozzle does not move to a position above the automatic probe "
"point, then `ABORT` the manual probe tool and perform the XY probe offset "
"calibration described above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the manual probe tool starts, follow the steps described at [\"the "
"paper test\"](Bed_Level.md#the-paper-test)) to determine the actual distance"
" between the nozzle and bed at the given location. Once those steps are "
"complete one can `ACCEPT` the position and save the results to the config "
"file with:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that if a change is made to the printer's motion system, hotend "
"position, or probe location then it will invalidate the results of "
"PROBE_CALIBRATE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the probe has an X or Y offset and the bed tilt is changed (eg, by "
"adjusting bed screws, running DELTA_CALIBRATE, running Z_TILT_ADJUST, "
"running QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL, or similar) then it will invalidate the results "
"of PROBE_CALIBRATE. After making any of the above adjustments it will be "
"necessary to run PROBE_CALIBRATE again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the results of PROBE_CALIBRATE are invalidated, then any previous [bed "
"mesh](Bed_Mesh.md) results that were obtained using the probe are also "
"invalidated - it will be necessary to rerun BED_MESH_CALIBRATE after "
"recalibrating the probe."
msgstr ""

msgid "Repeatability check"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After calibrating the probe X, Y, and Z offsets it is a good idea to verify "
"that the probe provides repeatable results. Start by homing the printer and "
"then move the head to a position near the center of the bed. Navigate to the"
" OctoPrint terminal tab and run the `PROBE_ACCURACY` command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command will run the probe ten times and produce output similar to the "
"following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ideally the tool will report an identical maximum and minimum value. (That "
"is, ideally the probe obtains an identical result on all ten probes.) "
"However, it's normal for the minimum and maximum values to differ by one Z "
"\"step distance\" or up to 5 microns (.005mm). A \"step distance\" is "
"`rotation_distance/(full_steps_per_rotation*microsteps)`. The distance "
"between the minimum and the maximum value is called the range. So, in the "
"above example, since the printer uses a Z step distance of .0125, a range of"
" 0.012500 would be considered normal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the results of the test show a range value that is greater than 25 "
"microns (.025mm) then the probe does not have sufficient accuracy for "
"typical bed leveling procedures. It may be possible to tune the probe speed "
"and/or probe start height to improve the repeatability of the probe. The "
"`PROBE_ACCURACY` command allows one to run tests with different parameters "
"to see their impact - see the [G-Codes document](G-Codes.md) for further "
"details. If the probe generally obtains repeatable results but has an "
"occasional outlier, then it may be possible to account for that by using "
"multiple samples on each probe - read the description of the probe `samples`"
" config parameters in the [config reference](Config_Reference.md#probe) for "
"more details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If new probe speed, samples count, or other settings are needed, then update"
" the printer.cfg file and issue a `RESTART` command. If so, it is a good "
"idea to [calibrate the z_offset](#calibrating-probe-z-offset) again. If "
"repeatable results can not be obtained then don't use the probe for bed "
"leveling. Klipper has several manual probing tools that can be used instead "
"- see the [Bed Level document](Bed_Level.md) for further details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Location Bias Check"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some probes can have a systemic bias that corrupts the results of the probe "
"at certain toolhead locations. For example, if the probe mount tilts "
"slightly when moving along the Y axis then it could result in the probe "
"reporting biased results at different Y positions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a common issue with probes on delta printers, however it can occur "
"on all printers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One can check for a location bias by using the `PROBE_CALIBRATE` command to "
"measuring the probe z_offset at various X and Y locations. Ideally, the "
"probe z_offset would be a constant value at every printer location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For delta printers, try measuring the z_offset at a position near the A "
"tower, at a position near the B tower, and at a position near the C tower. "
"For cartesian, corexy, and similar printers, try measuring the z_offset at "
"positions near the four corners of the bed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before starting this test, first calibrate the probe X, Y, and Z offsets as "
"described at the beginning of this document. Then home the printer and "
"navigate to the first XY position. Follow the steps at [calibrating probe Z "
"offset](#calibrating-probe-z-offset) to run the `PROBE_CALIBRATE` command, "
"`TESTZ` commands, and `ACCEPT` command, but do not run `SAVE_CONFIG`. Note "
"the reported z_offset found. Then navigate to the other XY positions, repeat"
" these `PROBE_CALIBRATE` steps, and note the reported z_offset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the difference between the minimum reported z_offset and the maximum "
"reported z_offset is greater than 25 microns (.025mm) then the probe is not "
"suitable for typical bed leveling procedures. See the [Bed Level "
"document](Bed_Level.md) for manual probe alternatives."
msgstr ""

msgid "Temperature Bias"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many probes have a systemic bias when probing at different temperatures. For"
" example, the probe may consistently trigger at a lower height when the "
"probe is at a higher temperature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is recommended to run the bed leveling tools at a consistent temperature "
"to account for this bias. For example, either always run the tools when the "
"printer is at room temperature, or always run the tools after the printer "
"has obtained a consistent print temperature. In either case, it is a good "
"idea to wait several minutes after the desired temperature is reached, so "
"that the printer apparatus is consistently at the desired temperature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check for a temperature bias, start with the printer at room temperature "
"and then home the printer, move the head to a position near the center of "
"the bed, and run the `PROBE_ACCURACY` command. Note the results. Then, "
"without homing or disabling the stepper motors, heat the printer nozzle and "
"bed to printing temperature, and run the `PROBE_ACCURACY` command again. "
"Ideally, the command will report identical results. As above, if the probe "
"does have a temperature bias then be careful to always use the probe at a "
"consistent temperature."
